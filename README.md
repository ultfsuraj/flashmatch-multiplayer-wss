4. Indicators shows whose turn it is, to avoid confusion
5. In case of network failure, accidentally closing the game or other issues, you can rejoin with same ROOM name and player name to restore the latest game state.
6. Both of you can use the same ROOM name and player names to play another game, new room name creates an entirely new game.

Game state is managed on client side. Which makes syncing game turns and events a bit complex, but reduces server load.

Broadcasting only moves and not entire game state reduces bandwidth usage during game play but complexity increases to manage turn sync, possibility of state out sync due to animation timing mismatchs and handling interference of socket event listeners from other games.

Play the games with your friends and comment any issues you face. ðŸ˜Š
